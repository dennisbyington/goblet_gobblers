# Description 

CLI implementation of the Goblet Gobblers board game 

  
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Game introduction:

Goblet Gobblers is a tic-tac-toe style board game where players can 'gobble' their opponents pieces.
Two players (X & O) begin with 6 pieces: 2 large, 2 medium, 2 small.

Players take turn placing pieces on the board. Players may choose a piece not in play or one on the board
already (although it is important to remember what has been 'gobbled' because uncovering an opposing player's
piece makes it active. Once piece is picked up it must be played. Larger pieces may nest on top of smaller
pieces only.  Play continues until someone wins.

Note: If moving a piece exposes a winning sequence for the opponent, and if the destination for the move
does not cover up one of the other pieces in the sequence, then the opponent winsâ€”even if the move makes a
winning sequence for the moving player.
