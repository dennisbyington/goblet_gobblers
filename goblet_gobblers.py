CLI implementation of the Goblet Gobblers board game

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general info:
-------------
game elements:
    board
    players (2)
    pieces (6 per player: 2 large, 2 medium, 2 small)

game play:
    players take turns placing pieces on the board
        may choose a piece not in play or one on the board already (need to remember what is nested)
    check for win after each turn (should not have a draw but may have a tie?)

rules:
    larger pieces may nest on top of smaller pieces only (must be >, not <=)
    if a piece is moved that is already on the board, what ever was below is now active
    play until someone wins.  Once piece is picked up it must be played

    NO TIES *************************
    If moving a piece exposes a winning sequence for the opponent, and if the destination for the move
    does not cover up one of the other pieces in the sequence, then the opponent winsâ€”even if the move
    makes a winning sequence for the moving player.

    * add pdf of rules into the folder (with any additional rules explained in comments here

** notes to add **
    - describe all data structures here instead of in each docstring
    - pieces will be removed from the pieces lists and inserted onto the board
        - will never have to add pieces back to the list, they must remain on the board once placed
    - each board internal list represents a spot on the board (will push/pop pieces)


** check here for additional/clarified rules: https://docs.racket-lang.org/games/gobblet.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

current TODO: incorporate pickup piece & play piece

later:
    - check win (no ties - see here: https://docs.racket-lang.org/games/gobblet.html)
    - rando choose 1st player
    - incorporate all together
    - refactor, python-ize (look at tpp and online code for ideas) & smooth
